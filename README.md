## Objectives
• Make a robot seek an object within a small area

• Make the robot grab the object and return it to the home position


## Pre-requisites
• Target is Lego Mindstorm EV3

• Target runs on a micro SDHC card burned with ev3dev Debian OS

• For this project, the robot will be controlled wirelessely, through Bluetooth

## Getting started
• Clone this repository straight to your robot's SD card (keep an eye out for future releases  where uncessary files will be removed)

• To start the program, connect to the robot through SSH using a terminal emulator such as PowerShell or PuTTy (on Windows), or ConnectBot, Termius (for Android), etc.

• Checkout to the src directory of the repository you just cloned (eg. ~/Git/search_and_rescue_bot/src/)

• Finally place your robot still on the floor and type in "python3 main.py" on your terminal emulator

• From there on, follow the instructions displayed on your terminal of choice, and you are all set ! Be sure to checkout user manual under ./docs/ for more information on this program.
